# SpotiToki
SpotiToki is a Spotify bot coded by Eliott 'Capn' Flechtner & Sebastien 'SixClones' Kerbourc'h that mutes Spotify's window when an ad is being played while still having every other sound active.

Program's only goal is to experiment with online APIs & web server requests as well as C# & Python
Took 3 full days to create, having never manipulated any API before.
Created in March 2019 but was posted on the 5th of June 2021.
